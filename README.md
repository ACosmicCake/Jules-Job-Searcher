# AI Job Agent

## Overview
A Python-based AI agent designed to assist in automating various parts of the job search process. It helps manage job applications by parsing CVs, storing user preferences, and (eventually) interacting with job platforms.

## Features (Planned & Current)
*   Parses CVs from DOCX and PDF formats (`cv_parser.py`).
*   Manages user's personal information and job search preferences via `config.json`.
*   Stores structured data extracted from CVs into `parsed_cv_data.json`.
*   Loads configuration and parsed CV data for use by the main agent (`agent.py`).
*   (Future) Tailors job applications using parsed CV data and cover letter templates.
*   (Future) Interacts with job boards or APIs to find and apply for jobs.

## Project Structure
Here's a brief overview of the key files and directories in this project:

*   `config.json`: Stores your personal information, job preferences, and paths to your CV files. **You must update this file.**
*   `cv_parser.py`: Python script responsible for reading CV files (DOCX and PDF) and extracting structured information.
*   `parsed_cv_data.json`: The JSON file where the structured data extracted from your CV will be stored. This file is generated by `cv_parser.py`.
*   `agent.py`: The main Python script that runs the AI agent, utilizing the configuration and parsed CV data.
*   `dummy_cv.docx`, `dummy_cv.pdf`: Example CV files provided for testing the parsing functionality.
*   `generate_dummy_docx.py`: Utility script to generate `dummy_cv.docx` (can be kept for reference or removed if not needed for end-users).
*   `generate_dummy_pdf.py`: Utility script to generate `dummy_cv.pdf` using `reportlab` (can be kept for reference or removed if not needed for end-users).
*   `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
*   Python 3.7 or newer.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-job-agent.git # Replace with actual URL
cd ai-job-agent
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
*   On macOS and Linux:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
*   On Windows:
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install python-docx pdfplumber reportlab
```
*   `python-docx`: For reading text from .docx files.
*   `pdfplumber`: For extracting text from .pdf files.
*   `reportlab`: Used by `generate_dummy_pdf.py` to create the sample PDF. (You may not need to install this if you don't re-run PDF generation and only use the parser).

### 5. Configure `config.json`
Open the `config.json` file and update it with your:
*   Personal information (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, etc.).
*   Job preferences (desired roles, locations, salary, etc.).
*   **Crucially, update `cv_paths`** to point to the actual location of your CV files (e.g., `"cv_paths": {"pdf": "path/to/your/cv.pdf", "docx": "path/to/your/cv.docx"}`).

### 6. Place Your CVs
Ensure your actual CV files (e.g., `my_cv.docx`, `my_cv.pdf`) are accessible by the paths you specified in `config.json`. You can place them in the project directory or any other location, as long as the path in `config.json` is correct.

## Usage

### 1. Parse Your CV
Before running the main agent, you need to parse your CV. This will extract text and attempt to structure it into `parsed_cv_data.json`.
```bash
python cv_parser.py
```
This script should (eventually) load your CV path from `config.json`, extract its content, parse it, and save the output to `parsed_cv_data.json`.

*(Note: The `cv_parser.py` is still under development. Currently, its main execution block contains test code. Future updates will integrate it with `config.json` for dynamic CV path loading and ensure `parsed_cv_data.json` is the primary output file for parsed data.)*

### 2. Run the Agent
Once your CV has been parsed and `config.json` is set up, you can run the AI agent:
```bash
python agent.py
```
The agent will load your configuration and the parsed CV data to perform its tasks.

## CV Parsing Details
The `cv_parser.py` script is designed to extract text from your CV and identify key sections such as:
*   Contact Information
*   Summary/Objective
*   Skills
*   Work Experience
*   Education
*   Projects

CV parsing is a complex task due to the wide variety of formats and layouts. The current parser uses a set of common section headings for identification. You might need to adjust the `COMMON_SECTION_HEADINGS` in `cv_parser.py` or enhance its logic if your CV format is not parsed correctly.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the agent or add new features:
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.
