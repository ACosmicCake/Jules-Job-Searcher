# AI-Powered CV Tailoring Program

## Description
This program helps you tailor your Curriculum Vitae (CV) to specific job descriptions using the power of Google's Gemini API. By providing your general CV and a target job description, the tool generates a version of your CV that is more aligned with the requirements and keywords of the job, potentially increasing your chances of landing an interview.

## Features
*   **Versatile CV Input:**
    *   Load your CV from a plain text file (`.txt`), a structured JSON file (`.json`), a PDF file (`.pdf`), or a DOCX file (`.docx`).
    *   Directly paste CV content into the console.
*   **Multiple Job Description Inputs:** Paste the job description directly into the console or load it from a text file (`.txt`).
*   **Gemini API Integration:** Leverages the Google Gemini API for intelligent text generation and CV tailoring.
*   **Secure API Key Management:** Your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is kept secure using a `.env` file, not hardcoded into the script.

## Setup Instructions
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (This will install `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`, `PyPDF2`, and `python-docx`.)

4.  **Create `.env` File:**
    In the project root directory, create a file named `.env`.

5.  **Add Your API Key:**
    Open the `.env` file and add your Google API key in the following format:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"` with your real API key obtained from Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console.

## Usage Instructions
1.  **Run the Script:**
    Execute the main program from the project root directory:
    ```bash
    python cv_tailor.py
    ```

2.  **Follow On-Screen Prompts:**
    The program will guide you through the following steps:
    *   **CV Input:** Choose to provide your CV via a JSON file, a plain text file, a PDF file, a DOCX file, by pasting it directly, or skip. Then enter the file path or paste content when prompted.
    *   **Job Description Input:** Choose to paste the job description or provide it via a text file, and then enter the content or file path.

3.  **View Tailored CV:**
    After processing, the tailored CV generated by the Gemini API will be printed directly to your console.

## Example Files
The project includes example files to help you get started:
*   `my_cv.txt`: A sample CV in plain text format.
*   `my_cv.json`: A sample CV in structured JSON format.
*   `job_description.txt`: A sample job description.
*   (You can create `my_cv.pdf` and `my_cv.docx` files for testing PDF and DOCX input).

You can use these files to test the program's functionality. For example, when prompted, you can use `my_cv.json` as the CV input and `job_description.txt` as the job description input.

## Future Enhancements
*   Option to save the tailored CV to a file.
*   Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
