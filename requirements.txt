# AI Job Agent Requirements

This file provides guidance on setting up the necessary environments for the AI Job Agent project.

## Backend (Python)

The backend is built using Python and FastAPI. Dependencies are managed in `webapp/backend/requirements.txt`.

To set up and run the backend:
1.  Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4.  Activate the virtual environment:
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
5.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r webapp/backend/requirements.txt
    ```
6.  Initialize the database (if not already done):
    ```bash
    python database_setup.py
    ```
7.  To run the backend development server:
    From the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    uvicorn webapp.backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

## Frontend (Vue.js / Node.js)

The frontend is built using Vue.js (with Vite) and requires Node.js (preferably LTS version) and npm.

To set up and run the frontend:
1.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd webapp/frontend
    ```
3.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  To start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically make the frontend available at `http://localhost:5173` or a similar address.

## Other Tools (Optional)

You might also want to install tools for linting, formatting, or pre-commit hooks based on project conventions (e.g., Black, Flake8 for Python; ESLint, Prettier for JavaScript/Vue). These are not explicitly listed here yet.
